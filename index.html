            <p>A refrigerator truck or chiller lorry (also called a Reefer), is a van or truck designed to carry perishable freight at
            low temperatures. Most long-distance refrigerated transport by truck is done in articulated trucks pulling refrigerated
            semi-trailersThe first successful mechanically refrigerated trucks were made for the ice cream industry in 1925.
            African American inventor Frederick McKinley Jones later contributed to the field. There were around 4 million
            refrigerated road vehicles in use in 2010 worldwide.</p>

            <h2>Cane Truck</h2>
            <p>A truck or lorry is a motor vehicle designed to transport cargo, carry specialized payloads, or perform other
            utilitarian work. Trucks vary greatly in size, power, and configuration, but the vast majority feature body-on-frame
            construction, with a cabin that is independent of the payload portion of the vehicle. Smaller varieties may be
            mechanically similar to some automobiles. Commercial trucks can be very large and powerful and may be configured to be
            mounted with specialized equipment, such as in the case of refuse trucks, fire trucks, concrete mixers, and suction
            excavators.</p>
